      description: 'The old man peered from under his green leaf at the danger, and stood as  quietly as the boy. For a few seconds this mutual scrutinizing went  on; then, the bear betraying a growing irritability, the boy, with a  movement of his head, indicated that the old man must step aside from  the trail and go down the embankment. The boy followed, going backward,  still holding the bow taut and ready. They waited till a crashing among  the bushes from the opposite side of the embankment told them the bear  had gone on. The boy grinned as he led back to the trail.'

      description: 'In the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between these heads. Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there is a certain mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whales which the Right Whales sadly lacks. There is more character in the Sperm Whales head. As you behold it, you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to him, in point of pervading dignity. In the present instance, too, this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the summit, giving token of advanced age and large experience. In short, he is what the fishermen technically call a grey-headed whale.'}]

Something very like the war fever that occasionally runs through a civilised community had got into my blood, and in my heart I was not so very sorry that I had to return to Maybury that night.  I was even afraid that that last fusillade I had heard might mean the extermination of our invaders from Mars.  I can best express my state of mind by saying that I wanted to be in at the death. It was nearly eleven when I started to return.  The night was unexpectedly dark;'}]

He fell thunderstruck on a seat.  He saw it all now.  He remembered that the time of sailing had been changed, that he should have informed his master of that fact, and that he had not done so.  It was his fault, then, that Mr. Fogg and Aouda had missed the steamer.  Yes, but it was still more the fault of the traitor who, in order to separate him from his master, and detain the latter at Hong Kong, had inveigled him into getting drunk!  He now saw the detectives trick; and at this moment Mr. Fogg was certainly ruined, his bet was lost, and he himself perhaps arrested and imprisoned!'}]
